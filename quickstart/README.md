## Quickstart Cluster with Ephemeral Storage

This is a basic quickstart ECK cluster that has no persistent storage.  It is meant for drop-in demos or fast exploration with deletion shortly thereafter.

Fleet and a DaemonSet of Agents are setup as well.  Each has several integrations you'd want for Kubernetes observability.  Kibana is preconfigured to load these Fleet policies and has it's own packaged APM solution enabled as well with more details on enabling this below. Lastly there is a trial license secret and instrucitons for deploying `kube-state-metrics` for certain metricsets.

These are just flat yamls that you can deploy at will and as long as the application permits it, leave off anything you dont want. For example:

`kubectl apply -f elasticsearch.yml -f kibana.yml -f fleet.yml -f legacy-apmserver.yml -f trial-license.yml`

## Viewing your Data in Kibana

You can use the built-in `elastic` user and the password is stored in a default secret. The command below should pull this value for you. 

`kubectl get secret elasticsearch-es-elastic-user -o=jsonpath='{.data.elastic}' | base64 --decode; echo`

You can then access the running Kibana by running a kubectl port-forward command like below or naturally, working to expose the cluster some other way.

`kubectl port-forward service/kibana-kb-http 5601`

## IMPORTANT: USING KIBANA APM

If you want the Kibana APM functionality to work, you need to first pull the apm-token secret via a command like the one below and paste it into the value on line 32 in kibana.yml, populating 

`kubectl get secret apm-server-apm-token -o=jsonpath='{.data.secret-token}' | base64 --decode; echo`

Then take that value and put it in the kibana.yml file like below(`here`).

```
  podTemplate:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: kibana
        env:
          - name: ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN
            value: "<here>"     
```

> NOTE: By default in this quickstart, the Kibana env var `ELASTIC_APM_ACTIVE` is set to `false`. You need to turn this to true after adding the token above.

## Adding Kube-State-Metrics

To add the kube-state-metrics server (a Kubernetes official resource) for the `state_*` metricsets, you can visit the repo or deploy the standard example directory resources after cloning the repo locally.

eg:
1. `git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics.git`
2. `kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics/examples/standard/`
